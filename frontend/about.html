    <div id=about>
        <div id=text>Humanity is not just about caring for one another, but also about extending compassion to all
            living creatures. Animals, especially those without homes, rely on our kindness to survive and thrive. In a
            bustling city like Tel Aviv, stray cats are a common sight, and they often go unnoticed or uncared for. It
            is our responsibility to offer them the love and nourishment they deserve.<br><br>
            Our community is dedicated to providing essential care for the stray cats of Tel Aviv. We ensure they have
            access to food, medical treatment, and, when possible, a path to finding loving homes. Feeding these cats is
            not just about satisfying hunger; itâ€™s about giving them a chance at a better life, full of care and
            compassion.<br><br>
            The goal of our community goes beyond just feeding. We aim to create a city where every stray cat can
            receive the love, medical attention, and, ultimately, the home they deserve. Together, we can make Tel Aviv
            a kinder place, one meal and one act of care at a time.
