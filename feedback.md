1. I really liked the idea for your hackathon, it’s ambitious, creative, and useful. You both did a great job on this.

2. It’s great that you commented on every step in your code. This really helps people like me, who need to read your code from scratch, understand it better and faster.

3. I can see from your code that you're knowledgeable about all the topics we covered in class, as well as other tools and concepts you’ve learned on your own. 

4. In conclusion, your code looks great—it’s clean and readable, which is a big plus for a developer! The final result of your project is impressive, especially considering the limited time you had.
